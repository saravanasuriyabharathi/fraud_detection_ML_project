# ML Engineer Practical Assessment – Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **production-grade machine learning pipeline**
built for a **real-world fraud detection problem**.  
The goal is not only to train a model, but to showcase **end-to-end ML
engineering skills**, including pipeline design, debugging, performance
improvement, and system-level thinking.

The implementation avoids AutoML and black-box solutions and follows a
modular, reproducible, and explainable approach suitable for production
environments.

## Problem Statement
Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a real-world dataset and
demonstrate:
- Data validation and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and evaluation
- Model debugging and stability fixes
- Performance improvement
- Production ML system design

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Type:** Binary Classification
- **Target Column:** `Class`
  - `0` → Legitimate transaction
  - `1` → Fraudulent transaction
- **Key Challenge:** Extreme class imbalance (~0.2% fraud cases)

This dataset represents a realistic financial fraud detection scenario.
